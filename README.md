# Challage TakeAway

## Objective
Make a Takeaway system that:
* Lists dishes with prices
* Orders:
    - Place orders by giving the list of dishes, their quantities.
    - Orders should calculate their total cost. 
    - Sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".

* Message
    - The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API.
    - You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
    - Use twilio-ruby gem to access the API

* Use a Gemfile to manage your gems

* Make sure that your Takeaway class is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
